	cifar100_curriculum_alexnet.py: curriculum learning for alexnet.

	cifar100_curriculum_resnet.py: curriculum learning for resnet.

	cifar100_kmeans.py: data clustering. 


Using k-means for clustering data hierarchically is quite simple. You can use [deep learning](https://github.com/elieJalbout/Clustering-with-Deep-learning) for clustering process.
